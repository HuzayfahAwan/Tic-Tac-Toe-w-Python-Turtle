# Tic-Tac-Toe-w-Python-Turtle

This project allows two players to play the game Tic-Tac-Toe against each other in an IDE's console (that supports Python Turtle). If this project is ran in Replit, for 
example, then it will function correctly because Replit supports Python Turtle. The user inputs into the console, and based on the user's input the Python Turtle draws 
on-screen.

NOTE: Make sure the Python Turtle window is in full-screen mode, so you can see what the Python Turtle is drawing for the Hangman game. You might have to adjust your window size, so you can see everything that the Python Turtle is drawing. Also, make sure you listen to the input instructions precisely! Otherwise, a while loop will run endlessly prompting the same thing over and over until you listen to the instructions in the console.

Have fun!
